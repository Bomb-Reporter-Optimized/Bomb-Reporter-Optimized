# Bomb-Reporter-Optimized
Application using React Native to help identify and rapidly report explosive hazards.

Please see wire frame road map for an idea and the original wire frame. 
Original App is here for Inspiration: https://github.com/Team-4-capstone/bomb-reporter

The constant constraint we have is that rapid reporting needs to always be 3 or less taps away.

Thank you for your help and contributions! 

This will be in the hands of Ukranians soon, so let's have fun and give them something to make their home safer!
